# Weather Station

A weather station based on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, DHT11 and PMS7003 is a project that allows you to collect meteorological and air quality data. It is a useful tool, especially for people who want to know the current weather conditions in their region or at home.

The project consists of three main components: the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, the PMS7003 air quality sensor and a control unit based on Raspberry Pi and Arduino. The DHT11 sensor measures air temperature and humidity, while the PMS7003 sensor measures the concentration of PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 particulate matter.

The control unit consists of a Raspberry Pi, which acts as a web server and a server on which services such as Grafana, influxDB, NodeRED and an Arduino, which manages the PMS7003 sensor and sends data to the Raspberry Pi. The Arduino and Raspberry Pi are connected via a serial interface.

The project also uses programming libraries for the DHT11 and PMS7003 to read and interpret sensor data.

The data collected by the weather station is stored in a database and can be used to generate weather reports and air quality information. All this data is displayed on a website hosted by the Raspberry Pi.

In conclusion, the weather station based on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, DHT11 and PMS7003 is a useful tool that allows you to collect meteorological and air quality data. With this project, you can access up-to-date weather and air quality information in real time.
